I sorted the data by the payment that is related to the year 2020 for presidential reelection. And then I analyzed the data in a pivot table. 

I listed all the committee names related to the election year 2020, and then added a column to see who all these committees have payed. For each party they paid, besides calculating the total amount they have paid to certain party, I also detailed how much they paid for a single transaction and for what reason. 

I found that in the 2020 election cycle, besides congressional candidates, all of the rest of the contributors are committees directly and indirectly related to Trump. 

Trump Victory and Trump make America great again committee are the two joint committees of Republican National Committee and Trump’s official website, which is Donald J. Trump for president Inc. Great America committee is initiated by Vice president Mike Pence. 

The only recipient of the payment from Trump Victory and Trump make America again committee is Trump’s official website which says that individual donation can’t exceed $2700. 

With these two joint committees, the individual donation has far exceeded $27,00, and they became the main sources of the financing of Trump’s campaign. One we

Trump Victory has so far donated $3.82 million for the 2020 election cycle while Trump make America again committee donated $20.38 million. In total, they take up 99.98 percent of the total donations that Trump Inc has received. And they are all in the name of transfer of net proceeds. 

The earliest transfer occurred in mid-January, 2017, days before Trump’s inauguration and the latest is a month ago, at the end of March. 

So far, the money payed by Trump Inc totaled 0.81 million, and they are mainly spent on Trump’s own restaurants, hotels, and towers for rent and travel expenses.
