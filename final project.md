[How economic leading powers will be aging by mid-21st century?](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I6Yumm63kHib_WlKcO3b3YKW7Whpu7O51ehwYbEuhiA/edit#gid=0) 

The world’s three largest economies are the United States, China and Japan. Their market productivity will determine the economic well-being of the rest of the world. And it matters even more being in the fast-developing globalizing 21st century. 

The overall improvement of living conditions have enabled people to live longer. While the population continue aging, there was relatively smaller working force to support the economy.  

According to a 2016 research by the National Bureau of Economic Research, when the the percentage of the population group 60 years and older increase 10 percent, the growth rate of GDP per capita will lower by 5.5 percent. And in the case of the age group of 65 years and older, the decrease is expected to be worse. 

Japan has long been known for its aging population problem, which is getting worse. While China is said to soon to have a similar problem worsened by its one child policy, the U.S.’s situation is not much better as the baby boomers generation started to age. 

Based on the data I compiled from U.S. census, Japan Statistics Bureau, National Bureau of Statistics of China, it was seen that all of the three countries is having a trend of having a larger and larger population of the age group of 65 years and older. 

The dataset was about the percentage of the population of the age group 65 years and older in the last 10 years of the three countries Japan, China and the United States, as each of them being a country that has already been experiencing aging population problem, a country that clearly shows evidence of having one in the near future, and the country that has just shown a sign of being in the same situation.

The year range of the data is from 1996 to 2016, during which all of the three countries are seeing significant progress in technological and medical advancement, most significantly in China, which has indirectly extended the life expectancy of people.

Japan has the highest starting point, 14.83 percent, and ending point, 27.30 percent, while it has the least number of residents. The U.S. population is 323.4 million, 2.5 times that of Japan, while China is almost 11 times that of Japan’s population, having a population of 1.379 billion. 

Japanese population is also growing most slowly among three countries, resulting from a constant low birth rate. China’s population has grown 13 percent in the last 10 years, and U.S. has gained 20 percent more of its population.

Although U.S. has 12.6 percent of older population in 1996, almost double that of China’s, 10 years later, it increased to 14.5 percent whereas China now increased to 10.8 percent, gradually closing the gap.

Based on calculation of the rough growth rate of the older generation group of these three countries, as they all showed almost a smooth upward trend, showed that America’s aging population had a minimal average 10-year growth rate of 0.095, while that of China is 0.22 and Japan 0.624.

However, the low average growth rate of America seemed only represents the period 1996 – 2011 with the year 2011 becomes the first generation of baby boomers who was born in 1946 turned 65. Based on calculations of the growth rate among that five-year period since 2011, the growth rate increased to 0.32, similar to that of China’s 0.34. 

Using that growth rate, it is possible to calculate a percentage of people who are 65 years and older in a certain year in the future. 

Putting Japan aside, the two countries, China and the U.S., who have similar growth rate were first compared. 

In the next few decades by 2050, if the growth rate remains steady, the United States will have about 25.38 percent of its population being people who are 65 years and older. China has a lower number of 22.36 percent. 

In other words, in 55 years from 1996, the United States will double its aged population, ending up one quarter of its citizens being 65 years and older. China, although still slightly lower in percentage than the United States as always, the aging population group more than tripled during this period. 

If the growth rate continues, Japan, by mid-21st century, will have over half of its population being or over 65 years old. That number more than quadrupled when entering the later half of the 21st century. 

The effect could be most serious for China, as it has a manufacturing dependent industry benefited from a overflow of labor force and thus low costs for labors, according to reports from China Power project of the think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies. 

According to the report, although the one-child policy has been terminated 2 years ago after 36 years of implementation, it will further shrink the labor force. The effect will also show on the total population of China. By 2025, Chinese population will peak at 1.4 billion and then started to decline, meaning that the large population advantage would even go away.

For the other two developed countries, the United States and Japan, they still have the possibility of continuing having technological advances to offset the drop in productivity from aging population. 

In its most recent editorials of the aging issue, the Japan times about the possible solutions of countering the effect. Besides putting more physical demanding work on robots. It also suggested an extension of retirement age, which Japan is already doing so and training older people for high-skilled jobs. 

The United States was not experiencing the same aging pressure as Japan does. Right now, multiple reports say that the problem is about not having enough qualified senior-care workers and possibly in the near term, there might be a shift of workers working in this field.
