The graph of the voter turnout by age in the 1980 - 2016 presidential elections (Figure four) is from the Current Population Survey sponsored by U.S. Censor Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, both of which are affiliated with the Federal government. So the primary source of the date is credible. Besides, the sample size is large enough as it is calculated from almost the entire U.S. population. 

On the U.S. census website, it is said that this survey was done biannually. The information they summarized every two years are the demographics of residents who voted or not, their numbers respectively, and the reasons of their voting or not voting. The census even collected specific demographics of the voters and their reasons for voting, then the voter turnout rate should be accurate at first place as it is the easiest thing to calculate among these three. 

The author of the article that has figure four is written by Thom File, staff in the Social, Economic and Housing Statistics Division. He has other related graphs in the article that’s about 1980 – 2016 voter turnout, which means he must have a set of data he has obtained for the article. And the article is about 2016 presidential election voter turnout, so he should have checked the data before the article was out. The simplest way to verify the data source is to contact the author and verify with him as he’s better at pulling data.

He also had another article about analyzing the 1964-2012 (link 2) voter turnout, the statistics he used are all marked that they are from U.S. census. This report has included the same data set of figure four. The report is recognized by U.S. Department of Commerce and U.S. Census Bureau, so its credibility is very high.
