[Estimated annual expenditures on a U.S. child born in 2013 by income group](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x8qzcvpLpAR3y7xstFzzVzaGTtLngN2FyVLdrqgRNGM/edit#gid=0)

I found this set of data in 2013 report of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, titled Expenditures on Children by Families. This data is a estimation of the annual costs of raising two children by a husband-wife family with an annual inflation rate of 2.4 percent averagely, varying by households’ income level, lowest, middle and the highest. 

Line graph is the most illustrative form is this case I think, but since I didn’t figure out how to add a bar chart under the line chart showing the aggregated expenditures for each of the three types of households. So I used the area chart to show the difference among them, as the covered area under each line equals to individual total expenditures. 

The y-axis was easy to set the range as the numbers spaced out evenly. The range I set for the expenditures is $5000 - $40,000, and the lines showed good contrast with each other. But when I set the range of the child age, it automatically only shows three data points, 5, 10 and 15. So I decided that I would not set the range. 

It is also a problem for me to make the graph show the costs for children who are only months old. That part of costs are not very insignificant to ignore it. I am not sure how to add units. I just added it in the names of the x-axis and y-axis. 

 Some findings about the graph. From it, I can tell that the expenditures usually increased dramatically when children enter primary, secondary school. And especially when they enter high school, the expenditure gap among all the households enlarge significantly, especially for the highest income household. These can be told by the smoothness of lines as well as increasing gaps between lines.
