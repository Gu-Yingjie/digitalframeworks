.[The Washington Post Story]. (http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp/2018/04/06/feature/in-reaction-to-trump-millions-of-americans-are-joining-protests-and-getting-political/?utm_term=.a814877b21bc)


# The Washington Post Poll showed how people are more politically engaged under Trump administration 

The article is written up based on the polling results of Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation Poll and interviews of people at the March for our lives. The Post gave the link of the poll in its first paragraph. The link takes readers to the page that includes everything about the poll including introduction, exact poll questions and results in percentage.

I like the piece as it has clear summary the main findings of the poll. For example, they pointed out that the rising population of active political engagement is more of older, white, well-educated people instead of young people. The article also gives a general look at the population such as they have equal percentage in gender and there are far more democrats than republicans among them. 

I also like how they give emphasized subtitles and graphics for each of the more detailed takeaways from the poll results. The organization of the poll data is efficient and when they portray rallygoers and non-rallygoers, it is very easy to tell. Rallygoers are in purple and holding posters while non-rallygoers are in grey while not holding anything. And they add human voices that are related to each individual finding so the poll results are humanized.

But it seems a bit confusing to me while they are illustrating the results. It was not said in the poll page how many people are involved, but I found that under the subtitle of the last poll finding. I am not sure of the number of people polled said here can apply to other poll results. If it is, why they pointed out how many people are polled almost at the end of the article. I also get lost a bit in the percentage out of percentage. For example, they said how many people attend rally in past two years and how many of the 20 percent have never attended before. Then it jumped to how many of all joined a rally because of Trump. 

I will be wondering how exactly it will affect the midterm elections according to the poll results. At the beginning of the article, it said that this will for sure aspect so I expected that the article would at least provide some guidance.
