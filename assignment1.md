Find one story from the past week (or so) that has a data component. It can be a visual, graphic, video or text story. Write 300 words about your thoughts on the story. You should write in complete English sentences and paragraphs, and you may use the first person. The kinds of things you might want to include are:
How did they use the data?
Can you tell where the data came from? Did they link to the source?
Was there anything about the story that was unclear?
What did you like about the story?
What are you still wondering about?
Include at least the following features in your writeup, to show you know how to use markdown:
A heading
A list or table
Hyperlinked text
Submit this assignment in your digitalframeworks repository as assignment1.md.
I strongly encourage you to complete this assignment in class. Submitting the first assignment is the hardest, and I'm here to help if you do it in class. I can't help you if you email me 20 minutes before deadline.
